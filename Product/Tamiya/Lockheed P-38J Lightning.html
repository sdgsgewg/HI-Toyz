              Developed in response to a February 1937 request from the armed
              forces for a fighter excelling in speed, firepower and range, the
              P-38 Lightning would be a wildly successful design that had around
              10,000 units produced and spawned numerous US ace pilots. While
              its design was constantly evolved from its maiden 1939 flight
              onwards, more powerful engines eventually overtook the P-38's
              cooling function, and output was limited to 1,250hp at higher
              altitudes. In August 1943 the answer to this problem appeared: the
              P-38J, which featured intercoolers moved from the wing leading
              edges to the underside of the engines. The superior cooling
              enabled use of its full 1,425hp even at high altitudes, while the
              newly-available leading edge space was not put to waste, being
              filled with auxiliary fuel tanks to improve the fighter's range.
