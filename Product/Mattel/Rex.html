                        This Roarin' Laughs Rex dinosaur toy from Disney and Pixar's Toy 
                        Story features more than 40 button-activated movie phrases, laughs 
                        and sounds. His head rotates 360 degrees, his mouth opens wide and 
                        his arms move comically to accentuate the funny dialogue and sounds. 
                        At about 15 inches long and 11 inches tall, the anxious but lovable 
                        T. rex figure can easily be manipulated by small hands. Colors and 
                        decoration may vary.

                            Hours of entertainment can be had with this Roarin' Laughs Rex 
                            dinosaur figure with arms that move comically as he speaks 40+

                            With his signature dialogue, sounds and earnest movements by 
                            too-short arms, this large-scale figure really captures the 
                            personality of the lovable character from Disney and Pixar's 
                            Toy Story movies.

                            The big green dinosaur toy makes a great playtime companion, 
                            and his size makes posing and action play easy, even for small 
                            hands. He's about 10.8 inches tall, 15 inches long and 6 inches wide.

                        <li>
                            He's too big for his box! Figure requires one-time assembly of 
                            one leg and tail. Attachment is then permanent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This big toy is a funny gift for Toy Story fans 4 years and older.
